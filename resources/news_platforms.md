Dear Good News Network Team,

My name is Hannah Claus, I am a Master’s student at Queen Mary University of London, UK and a Google DeepMind scholar. At the moment I am finishing my Master’s Thesis in Artificial Intelligence on the impact of positive news on society. 

I came across your website and was wondering whether you could answer a few questions on how you choose these specific articles that appear on your website for my research purposes. In my thesis I am arguing that these kinds of stories are usually underrepresented, which can have severe impacts on people’s mental health. Which is why it is so important to share positive news like you do. But automating this by using machine learning/artificial intelligence algorithms is not that easy, as each article is different. In order to compare my results to current state-of-the-art, I would like to get to know anything you can share on your criteria for your good news. This might help me to conclude that we still need humans, specifically well trained and experienced journalists, that will moderate and create these important news articles.

You can have a look at my current work here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-claus-042382199/

With so many bad news and fake news that we consume on a daily basis, it is essential to find a balance and hear about some positive things happening in the world. Your good news stories have often made me smile and brightened my day, so I would really appreciate it, if you could spare a few minutes and reply to my email. Thank you!

With best regards,

Hannah
