# Project Objectives

## List a series of objectives you need to achieve in order to fulfil the aims of your project.

The main objective is to create a framework for a classifier which discriminates between positive and negative news. In order to receive the best possible outcomes, there will be three types of models:
* baseline model
* optimised baseline model
* optimised Large Language Models (LLMs)

These three types of models will be trained and tested on three types of classifications of news articles:
* headlines
* content
* headlines + content

Hence, at the end, there will be a minimum of nine different classifiers that can be prepared to each other and to the current state-of-the-art.

## State how your project will be aligned with the learning outcomes of your programme of study.

The framework will be written in Python, using TensorFlow and Keras libraries, as well as other packages that were introduced during the lectures. Utilising the skills and knowledge acquired from the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning lectures, the neural networks will be built using familiar environments, converting theory into practice.
