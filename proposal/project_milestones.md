# Project Milestones

## Indicate what measurable/tangible components you will produce as part of this project.  This may take the form of deliverable document(s) or developmental milestones such as a working piece of software/hardware. 

The final component will be the framework, which would be available open-source. When breaking the various parts of the framework down, it is easily separated into the dataset and the classifier. The dataset contains self-annotated data, which will be made publicly-available. 
The classifier component entails the three developed types of classifiers, which were all trained and tested with three types of data, hence, at least 9 different classifiers. 

This framework can then be used to successfully classify a news article as positive or negative.
