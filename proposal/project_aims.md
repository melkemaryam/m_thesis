## State the design, development or research challenge (problem) that the project aims to solve.

The main goal is to create a machine learning (ML) classifier which discriminates between relatively positive and relatively negative news. The motivation behind this goal is to provide users with international uplifting news which potentially improves the user's mental health and supports progress in society.

At the moment, trained journalists go through news providers manually to select uplifting news. However, this can be simplified and automated by utilising a neural network. This way, more positive news can be made accessible in less time and without linguistic limitations regarding different languages. Nevertheless, the first step is to create such a classifier for international news written in English. This can then be extended to be applied in other languages as well.
